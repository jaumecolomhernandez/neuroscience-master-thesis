# Data-driven model of endogenous and exogenous electric fields modulation of cerebral cortex activity

Code repository for the master thesis, named Data-driven model of endogenous and exogenous electric fields modulation of cerebral cortex activity. The thesis is part of the masters in mathematics (MAMME), and it has been developed in collaboration with CNRS (Alain Destexhe) and IDIBAPS (Mavi Sanchez-Vives).

In the repository you can find the final code for the model analysis ([model_analysis.ipynb](model_analysis.ipynb)), data processing ([data_processing.ipynb](data_processing.ipynb)) and model fitting ([model_fitting.ipynb](model_fitting.ipynb)).

To run the notebooks you need basic scientific python libraries. Pandas, Numpy, Scipy and MatPlotLib. To read .smr files the Neo library is required. The conda environment manager is recommended for managing the packages and configuring an environment for the project.
